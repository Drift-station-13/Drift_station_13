## Drift station's policy on mature content.
Drift Station 13 derives its initial codebase from Citadel, the reason for this is because when choosing a TG base, it was the closest in the functionality we wanted. But Drift Station 13 does not approve of sexual content so it is not accessible during gameplay & will be eventually completely removed from the code. ERP is not a part of the Drift Station 13 community vision.

I hope this is not seen as an attack on Citadel or its player base we have no ill will towards them, but we are trying to create a different type of community.

Drift Station 13, like a lot of servers, can be traced back to /tg/station and was forked from Citadel.

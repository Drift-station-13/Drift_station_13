For now TG's mapmerge2 tool is used for this codebase but in the near future a 
new tool will be introduced to take its place.

here is a python install link if anyone needs it.
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-amd64.exe
Install Python
run requirements-install.bat

I do not reccomend using hooks it can create issues for example on my system I 
have WSL installed & git was trying to use the python install there and not
the native win32 one. I find it easy to just run it manualy.

but to install the hooks run install.bat in hooks tool folder
